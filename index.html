         <h1> Get Your Bahamas Pet Import Permit Online</h1>
            <p>
              My name is Wellington, and I would love to help you obtain a
               Bahamas Pet Import Permit, but also save you time and money!
              </p><p>
               <strong> No trips to the bank, post office or FedEx!</strong>
            </p><p>
                 Just send me the completed form and I’ll take care of the rest..
                   The normal process for receiving a Bahamas Department of
                    Agriculture Pet Import Permit can be frustrating and time consuming,
                     since the permit is not available to be processed online, and 
                     payment must be made by cash or international money order, either in person or by mail.
                </p><p>
                      We all know sending cash isn’t the smartest idea. 
                      What happens it if just “disappears” or “isn’t received” – 
                      not only are you out the money, but you may be in a situation
                       that you no longer have time to apply for another permit.
                    </p><p>
                         While FedEx is somewhat better than mail,
                          it is costly (about $60 from the US to Nassau, Bahamas) and inconvenient.
                        </p><p>
                          I’m here to help make this process smoother and cheaper.
           
                           </p>
                             <h2>Here’s how it works: (Scroll down for Video Tutorial)</h2>

                                 <p>

                                     per pet and a copy of rabies certificate

                                that the permit has been approved,
                              I will collect your permit(s) and then email you the permit(s)

                     <h1>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h1>
              <p> <strong>My service
                   is not a guarantee the permit will be granted.</strong> This is solely the decision for the Bahamas Department of Agriculture and I have no influence on that decision.However, in my experience the applications are generally granted if the requirements are met and the proper documentation is provided during the application.I help to make sure that is the case so you avoid the unfortunate situation of a denial or the back-and-forth that may happen when the documentation is incorrect.
                   </p><p> 
            <strong> The USDA APHIS form or a
                 “Pet Passport” IS NOT required for entry.
                 </strong><a href="#">USDA’s APHIS website</a> 
                 refers visitors back to the Bahamas Department of Agriculture form.
        </p><p>
       <strong> The Bahamas Pet Import Application has
            recently changed </strong>(July 2017) and many old
             versions are still available,<a href="#"> such as this one
                  from bahamas.com (official tourism website) </a> <strong>
                       Do not use the old permit form, <a href="#">download
                            the correct application</a> from my site.</strong>

                $27 each additional entry for the same pet
                You may request more than one visit permit 
                per application. Each additional visit permit (additional entry for the same pet) 
                is $27 due to additional complexity and time required.

                <p class="ctn-rates-text"  >
                    A different pet will require a separate application and therefor a separate $57 fee,

                        the Department of Agriculture.
                        I will do my best to expedite the process for you. I have been able to get them in as short a time as 3-5 business
                         days although I can not guarantee any specific timeframe.</p>
